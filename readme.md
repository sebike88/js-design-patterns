What are javascript design patterns?

Design patterns are advanced object-oriented solutions to commonly occurring software problems.  Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.  Each pattern has a name and becomes part of a vocabulary when discussing complex design solutions.

What is a closure?

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — a scope chain.

The closure has three scope chains:
  - it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets
  - it has access to the outer function’s variables
  - it has access to the global variables

What are prototypes?

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
